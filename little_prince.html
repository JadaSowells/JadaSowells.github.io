                Then <span class="highlight-red">the little prince</span> said, "<span class="highlight-green">I do</span> not have <span class="highlight-yellow">much time</span>. I have friends to discover and many things to understand." 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "<span class="highlight-green">One</span> can only understand the things one <span class="highlight-green">tames</span>," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, <span class="highlight-yellow">tame me</span>..."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "<span class="highlight-red">What must I do</span>, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "<span class="highlight-green">You must be very patient</span>," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me, like that, in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The next day the little prince came back.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "<span class="highlight-yellow">It would have been better</span> to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "<span class="highlight-red">What is a rite</span>?" asked the little prince.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours."
